Hello, we are going to create a project called LaraProject

The proccess of creating the project may take a couple minutes, be calm...

This .env file is responsible for the project connection to the database. 

There are two files reponsible for that connection:
- config/database.php
- root project .env file

Once we configure the connection, we must run migrate install to install migration to the database.
$ php artisan migrate:install

To clean the cache that might get you bored, you should cache clear
$ php artisan cache:clear

Alright, lets gets our hands on!

That error occurs because storage doesnt have enough permission. That happened because we've created the project. Do so
to fix this error. It works!!

We've built our model and our migration. Now we've to configure the database to receive these data.

Everything worked fine! Our tables were created, the migration has been made successfully!!!

When we ran the command php artisan db:seed we've just ran the code to create fake data. The fake data
defined previously!

Thats all, thank you!!
